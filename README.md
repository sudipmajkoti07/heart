# Heart FastAPI Project

This repository contains a FastAPI application designed to [insert brief description of what the app does, e.g., "serve a machine learning model for heart disease prediction" or "provide a simple API for heart-related data"]. This README provides instructions for setting up and running the app locally, as well as accessing a cloud-deployed version.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- A terminal or command-line interface
- (Optional) A virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv`

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the FastAPI app locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   If you haven’t already, clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/heart.git
Navigate to the Project Folder
Change into the project directory:
bash
cd heart
Install the Required Dependencies
Install all necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI App
Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn with auto-reload enabled for development:
bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
Access the App Locally
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000
You should see the app running! For API endpoints, check the automatic interactive documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
Cloud Deployment
The model/app is also deployed in the cloud for easy access. You can interact with it at the following URL:
[Insert cloud URL here, e.g., https://heart-app.herokuapp.com]  
(Note: Replace the placeholder with the actual deployed URL if available.)
Troubleshooting
Port Conflict: If http://127.0.0.1:8000 is unavailable, another process might be using port 8000. Stop the conflicting process or run the app on a different port with uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001.
Dependency Errors: Ensure your Python version matches the requirements and that requirements.txt is correctly formatted.
